PLACEHOLDER FILE DESCRIPTION

The actual 4D diffusion MRI image file (4d_image.nii.gz) would be placed in this directory.
It is not included in this repository due to its large size (typically 50-100 MB per subject).

For a real implementation, this file would contain:
- A 4D NIfTI format image
- Dimensions: approximately 128 x 128 x 60 x 46 (X x Y x Z x Directions)
- Contains 1 baseline (b=0) image and 45 diffusion-weighted volumes (b=1000 s/mmÂ²)
- Corresponds to the gradient directions specified in the bvec file
- Corresponds to the b-values specified in the bval file

To obtain real diffusion MRI data, please apply for access to the ADNI database
